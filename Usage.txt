 A Short And Simple Batch Program would be as:

 call MenuBar File f0 _Box _Hover

 :mouse
 REM Enabling Mouse Interaction with Cmd... Using 'GetInput'
 GetInput /M %_BOx% /H %_Hover%

 Call Check_MenuBar_Click.bat %Errorlevel% _Menu_Option _Sub_menu_option

 This version 2.0 of MenuBar function contains much more GUI Capabilities.
 As it uses batbox.exe and calls it only once at the end of calculation...
 For the most efficient output. This ver. uses GetInput By Aacini too. For the
 Advanced Output on the console.
